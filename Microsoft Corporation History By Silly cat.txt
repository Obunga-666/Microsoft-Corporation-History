1975–1985: Founding and Early Growth

Microsoft began as “Micro-soft,” a portmanteau of microcomputer and software, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen adapted BASIC for the Altair 8800 and licensed it to MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

- April 4, 1975: Company founded by Gates (then Harvard student) and Allen (Honeywell programmer)  
- November 26, 1976: Registered as Micro-Soft with New Mexico’s Secretary of State  
- January 1, 1979: Headquarters moved to Bellevue, Washington, to attract talent  

During this period, Microsoft focused on programming languages (BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL) for CP/M and other early microcomputers, reaching $1 million in annual revenue by 1978.

1980s: IBM Partnership, MS-DOS, and Windows

In 1980, Microsoft struck a landmark deal to provide the operating system for IBM’s first PC, purchasing and adapting 86-DOS (renamed MS-DOS), then retaining rights to sell it to other manufacturers.

- 1981: MS-DOS released with IBM PC; Microsoft incorporated in Washington  
- 1983: First hardware product, the Z-80 SoftCard, enables Apple II to run CP/M  
- November 1983: Launch of Microsoft Word (originally “Multi-Tool Word”)  
- November 20, 1985: First version of Windows announced, introducing a graphical user interface  

By the late 1980s, MS-DOS and Windows had secured Microsoft’s dominance in PC operating systems, with Windows 3.0 (1990) capturing over 90% market share.

1990–2000: Expansion, Antitrust, and the Internet

Microsoft deepened its product lineup with Office (1989), Internet Explorer (bundled with Windows 95), and Xbox (announced 2000). The company’s growth triggered regulatory scrutiny:

- 1995: Windows 95 launches, fully integrating MS-DOS and GUI  
- 1998: U.S. Department of Justice files antitrust suit, accusing Microsoft of unfair bundling practices  
- 2000: Bill Gates steps down as CEO; Steve Ballmer succeeds him; Microsoft reports annual net income above $2 billion for the first time  

Despite legal challenges, Microsoft’s earnings soared during the dot-com boom, and its Windows/Office franchise remained highly profitable.

2000–2014: Diversification and New Leadership

Under Steve Ballmer, Microsoft diversified into cloud computing, entertainment, and mobile hardware:

- 2001: Windows XP released internationally  
- 2005: Launch of Xbox 360 gaming console  
- 2008–2010: Introduction of Azure cloud platform and Office 365 subscription model  
- 2012: Release of Surface tablets, marking Microsoft’s entry into PC hardware  
- 2013: Acquisition of Nokia’s mobile phone business to bolster Windows Phone efforts  

By 2014, Microsoft had become a leader in enterprise software and cloud services but struggled in mobile operating systems.

2014–Present: The Nadella Era, Cloud, and AI

Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as CEO in February 2014 and steered Microsoft toward cloud-first, mobile-first strategies:

- 2016: Acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion  
- 2018: Purchase of GitHub, enhancing Microsoft’s appeal to developers  
- 2020: Microsoft Teams surpasses 115 million daily active users amid the COVID-19 shift  
- 2021–2024: Major AI investments, including partnerships with OpenAI, integration of AI into Microsoft 365 (Copilot), and expansion of Azure AI services  

Today, Microsoft operates three core business segments—Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing—and maintains research labs worldwide to drive innovation in AI, mixed reality, and quantum computing.
